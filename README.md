## Pulling the Latest Code from GitHub

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
If you haven't cloned the repository yet, use:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```
Replace `yourusername/your-repo-name` with your actual **GitHub repository**.

cd your-repo-name

### Step 3: Pull the Latest Changes

If your branch is different, replace `main` with your branch name.

## Running the Website Locally (Python HTTP Server)

### Step 1: Open Terminal/Command Prompt and Navigate to the Project Directory
```sh
cd your-repo-name
```

### Step 2: Start the Python HTTP Server
For Python 3:
```sh
python -m http.server 8000
```

### Step 3: Open in Browser
Once the server is running, open:
```
http://localhost:8000/
```
in your browser.

Your website should now be live locally.

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" or Python Not Installed
Check if Python is installed:
```sh
python --version
```
If not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Port 8000 is Already in Use
Use another port, such as `8080`:
```sh
python -m http.server 8080
```
Then, open:
```
http://localhost:8080/
```
in your browser.
